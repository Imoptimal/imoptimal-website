                <p><b>You managed to get some traffic to your small business website, but have trouble converting enough visitors into clients?</b><br>The checklist I've created will help you increase the conversion rate - by improving all the technical aspects of your website (speed, accessibility, privacy and security).</p>

                  <button>Get 'Website Foundations' checklist</button>
                </div>
                <p>Maybe you've already checked your website through online testing tools like PageSpeed Insights (by Google). The problem is that you still don't know where to start with their overly technical recommendations on improving your website. That's why I created this checklist, with items everyone can understand. Not only that, but I've created complementary tutorials - full of actionable steps & easy to follow screenshots.</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <p>In today's world, where everyone is used to fast loading apps and websites, you shouldn't lag behind. Your website visitors are not the only ones that value fast websites - search engines do it also. Website speed is one of the main factors for SEO ranking. Thus, website speed optimisation: improves visibility of the website, ensuring more visitors (and potential clients); lowers bounce rate (visitors stay longer), increasing the chances for conversion.</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <p>Like the website speed optimization, web accessibility is also crucial for improving your website's conversion rate and SEO ranking. That's because it increases the size of your potential audience (and the number of potential clients); it improves the user experience for all of your website visitors (increasing the time they stay on a page, and the chance they'll convert).</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <p>Having a privacy policy on your website, not only helps you avoid legal troubles (since it's a requirement in most parts of the world) - it helps you build trust with your website's visitors. That trust: helps you keep more clients, since many people end their relationship with companies over data privacy concerns; it enables a longer-term relationship with your clients (increasing their lifetime value - amount of money they spend on your products/services).</p>

                    <p>Data privacy concerns often lead to loss of clients, and prevent forming long-term relationship with them. But it's not enough just to have a good privacy policy - you need to stand by it and practice what you preach. Website security best practices are fundamental in ensuring that all the user data stays safe, and most importantly: it prevents you from loosing money on potential data breach lawsuits; it helps you avoid a variety of costly consequences of hacker attacks (malware, ransomware, etc.).</p>
