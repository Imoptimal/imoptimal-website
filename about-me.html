                <p>Hi, I'm Ivan MaljukanoviÄ‡, living in Zagreb, Croatia.</p>
                <img class="lazy-loading" data-src="../img/about-me/just-me.webp" alt="Why choose me (my unfiltered photo)" draggable="false" width="600" height="600" />

                <p>It's understandable that you could feel anxious about the decision, to give your trust to someone you don't know
                    yet. Especially when it comes to a long-term commitment like website building and maintenance. <b>Here are 5 things about me and my approach to work</b>, that will show if I'm a good fit for your small business:</p>

                <img class="lazy-loading"

                <div class="story">
                    <p><span>1/5</span> Like you, I'm also a small business owner. That's why I know the struggles of multitasking in your
                        daily life
                        - from the different hats you need to wear at work, to an equally complicated personal life. It's completely
                        different to be working on your own or with just few people, than to have a dozen of others at your disposal
                        that could take on any needed role.</p>

                    <p><span>2/5</span> You can expect to be working with me one-on-one, from start to finish. You won't be treated like a
                        number in
                        a queue, or delegated to other team members (since I'm a team of one). Don't worry, I never take more
                        clients than I can handle. Each of my clients gets a reserved amount of time during a work week. I don't
                        take new projects before everything is done for existing clients.</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <p><span>3/5</span> My approach to building a small business website is holistic - every action is taken with both
                        technical and
                        business side in mind. While I'm proud to say that I'm a coder, I don't just create a website - I help you
                        achieve desired business goals. Just have in mind that a successful website doesn't happen overnight. It
                        takes continuous work and collaboration between us.</p>

                    <p><span>4/5</span> Every decision made is based on data (collected on your website, and from scientific research on
                        user
                        behavior). Even though there can never be enough data, and each piece of it should be analyzed carefully -
                        it's always better to make informed decisions, than blind guesses. The data collected on your small business
                        website is your ownership, and you can check it freely whenever needed.</p>

                    <p><span>5/5</span> You're always free to go and take your small business website elsewhere, at no additional cost.
                        Since I
                        prefer to use open-source solutions, you're never locked in. There are many proprietary platforms that seem
                        simple to get started. But once something more custom is needed, it becomes costly to either stay or leave.
                        You should never be forced to start from scratch if we part our ways.</p>

                <p>The <b>values</b> I stand behind:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I believe you should be yourself in life and business, not just what others expect from you. If you can't be <b>authentic</b> in your everyday life, you'll be miserable.</li>
                  <li>There's no point in creating business that's just another obligation in your life, and brings you no joy. You have the <b>freedom</b> to organize your business and life as you want, not according to other people's rules.</li>
                  <li>It's not only a good business decisions to optimize your website (because it converts better). Faster websites result in a more <b>sustainable</b> web - by using less resources and leaving a smaller carbon footprint.</li>
                  <li>Likewise, making your website more accessible doesn't only increase it's conversion, but it helps build more <b>inclusive</b> online spaces for otherwise marginalized social groups.</li>      
                  <li>Choosing <b>open-source</b> tools over proprietary software (when possible) makes you more independent in the future business decisions. That way you're not limited by the choices of another business.</li>
                </ul>
