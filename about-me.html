            <h2>Why should you choose to work with me? (About me)</h2>
            <div class="section just-text">
                <p>It's understandable that you could feel anxious about the decision, to give your trust to someone you don't know
                    yet. Especially when it comes to a long-term commitment like website building and maintenance. Here are few
                    things about me and my approach to business, that will hopefully show you I'm trustworthy:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section one">
                <img class="lazy-loading"

                    alt="Small business website - why choose me (Nobody knows your struggles like another small business owner.)" draggable="false" width="600" height="600" />
                <div class="story">
                    <p>Like you, I'm also a small business owner. That's why I know the struggles of multitasking in your daily life
                        - from the different hats you need to wear at work, to an equally complicated personal life. It's completely
                        different to be working on your own or with just few people, than to have a dozen of others at your disposal
                        that could take on any needed role.</p>
                </div>

                    alt="Small business website - why choose me (Don't be treated like just one more client in a queue!)" draggable="false" width="600" height="600" />
                <div class="story">
                    <p>You can expect to be working with me one-on-one, from start to finish. You won't be treated like a number in
                        a queue, or delegated to other team members (since I'm a team of one). Don't worry, I never take more
                        clients than I can handle. Each of my clients gets a reserved amount of time during a work week. I don't
                        take new projects before everything is done for existing clients.</p>

                    alt="Small business website - why choose me (Get more than a website - get a solution!)" draggable="false" width="600" height="600" />
                <div class="story">
                    <p>My approach to building a small business website is holistic - every action is taken with both technical and
                        business side in mind. While I'm proud to say that I'm a coder, I don't just create a website - I help you
                        achieve desired business goals. Just have in mind that a successful website doesn't happen overnight. It
                        takes continuous work and collaboration between us.</p>

                <img class="lazy-loading"

                    alt="Small business website - why choose me (Don't make blind guesses, make informed decisions instead.)" draggable="false" width="600" height="600" />
                <div class="story">
                    <p>Every decision made is based on data (collected on your website, and from scientific research on user
                        behavior). Even though there can never be enough data, and each piece of it should be analyzed carefully -
                        it's always better to make informed decisions, than blind guesses. The data collected on your small business
                        website is your ownership, and you can check it freely whenever needed.</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <p>You're always free to go and take your small business website elsewhere, at no additional cost. Since I
                        prefer to use open-source solutions, you're never locked in. There are many proprietary platforms that seem
                        simple to get started. But once something more custom is needed, it becomes costly to either stay or leave.
                        You should never be forced to start from scratch if we part our ways.</p>
