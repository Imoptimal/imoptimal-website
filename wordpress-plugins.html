                <p>On this page you'll find advice about the must have features for any small business website. Also,
                    you'll get WordPress plugin recommendations, to help you add those features to your website. If you
                    want

                        recommendations</a>.</p>
                <p>Now, lets start with the must have features for any small business website. Those features could be
                    categorized roughly into four main areas:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section one">
                <h2>1. Essential information:</h2>
                <img class="lazy-loading"
                    data-src="../img/wordpress-plugins/small-business-website-wordpress-plugins-quote-1.png"
                    alt="Be clear. (Small business website expert quote)" draggable="false" width="600" height="600" />
                <div class="story">
                    <h3>1.1 Compelling messaging</h3>
                    <p>Your small business website should clearly convey a value proposition to your target audience. It
                        should highlight your expertise, experience, and the benefits you offer to potential clients.
                        This will help them quickly determine if you're a good fit for their needs.</p>
                    <h3>1.2 Comprehensive service overview</h3>
                    <p>Clearly outline the range of the services that your small business offers (with pricing if
                        possible), and use simple language without jargon. This will make it easy for visitors to
                        understand your offering, and decide to go ahead and contact you for collaboration.</p>
                    <h3>1.3 Prominent contact information</h3>
                    <p>Make it easy for visitors to find your contact information - including phone numbers, email
                        addresses, and physical address of your small business. Also, include clear and easy-to-use
                        contact form(s) for visitors to inquire about services or request a consultation.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section two">
                <h2>2. User experience:</h2>
                <img class="lazy-loading"
                    data-src="../img/wordpress-plugins/small-business-website-wordpress-plugins-quote-2.png"
                    alt="Be accessible. (Small business website expert quote)" draggable="false" width="600"
                    height="600" />
                <div class="story">
                    <h3>2.1 Mobile responsive design</h3>
                    <p>Ensure that your small business website is easy to navigate and view on all devices, including
                        smartphones and tablets. This is crucial, because nowadays a significant portion of website
                        traffic comes from mobile devices.</p>
                    <h3>2.2 Easy navigation</h3>
                    <p>Your small business website should have a clear and intuitive navigation structure, that makes it
                        easy for visitors to find the information they need. Avoid complex menus or excessive clutter
                        (on your website in general).</p>
                    <h3>2.3 Strong calls to action (CTAs)</h3>
                    <p>Include prominent CTAs throughout your small business website, encouraging visitors to take
                        action - such as contacting you for consultation, requesting a quote, or downloading valuable
                        resources.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h3>3.1 About us section</h3>
                    <p>Provide a concise overview of history, team, values, and mission of your small business.
                        Highlight the qualifications and experience of your employees and any certifications or awards.
                        This will help potential clients build trust and confidence in your capabilities.</p>
                    <h3>3.2 Client testemonials</h3>
                    <p>Showcase positive testimonials from satisfied clients to further establish credibility and trust
                        of your small business. Include compelling case studies that demonstrate your expertise and the
                        positive impact you have on clients' businesses.</p>
                    <h3>3.3 Regularly updated content</h3>
                    <p>Keep your small business website fresh and engaging with regular updates, including blog posts,
                        industry news articles, and helpful resources for potential clients. It will also help your SEO
                        (search engine optimization) efforts.</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <h3>4.1 Search engine optimization (SEO)</h3>
                    <p>Implement SEO strategies to improve your small business website's ranking in search engine
                        results pages (SERPs). This will increase your visibility and organic traffic from potential
                        clients searching for services you offer. In short, there are three main types of SEO: a)
                        on-page SEO - anything you do with website content to improve rankings, such as using relevant
                        keywords; b) off-page SEO - anything you do outside of your website to improve rankings, such as
                        building backlinks; and c) technical SEO - anything you do on the technical side of things, such
                        as improving page speed or alt-text on your images etc.</p>
                    <h3>4.2 Security & data privacy</h3>
                    <p>Ensure that your small business website has a valid SSL certificate, which encrypts all data
                        transmitted between the website and its visitors. This protects sensitive information and
                        instills confidence in potential clients. Also, implement clear data privacy policies to protect
                        client information that's collected through your website (by you or third party service
                        providers you use), to be compliant with widespread regulation (GDPR in the EU region, etc.).
                    </p>
                    <h3>4.3 Web accessibility</h3>
                    <p>You should make sure your small business website is accessible - meaning it's designed in a way
                        that doesn't prevent people with disabilities (mainly visual impairment), to use it. This is
                        important not just because of the legal liability, but mainly because you widen your user base
                        and increase the number of potential clients.</p>

                <p><b>WordPress</b> provides good basis for any small business website, being lightweight and offering 
                    basic features
                    for
                    a simple blog. For everything else, you need to select one theme and multiple plugins that will
                    provide you with
                    any additional feature you need. Best of all - in most use cases, you can get everything completely
                    for free
                    (with an option to upgrade to premium if and when needed).</p>

                        WordPress theme you choose. If you ask me - the best theme is the one that provides advanced
                        features
                        (that's usually provided by plugins commonly known as page builders). Theme I use for every of
                        my projects,
                        that provides many starter templates for free, and is lightweight (providing fast loading times)

                        would
                        usually need a separate plugin for (contact form, testemonials and advanced image gallery).</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <p>If you need something simple for your small business website (one step form with basic fields -
                        name, email,
                        text of the message), then you can use a form block provided by the Kadence blocks plugin. It
                        comes
                        complementary to the KadenceWP theme, as I mentioned before. For anything more complex, I
                        suggest you to use
                        <a title="Ninja forms wordpress.org page" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/"

                        content
                        (images and videos). Videos should never be hosted on your server, but embedded on your website

                        YouTube,
                        etc.). On the other hand, images should be hosted on your server (uploaded through WordPress).
