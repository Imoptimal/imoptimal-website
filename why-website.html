                        potential customers. Also, it allows you to showcase your products, services, and the story of your business

                    <p>A website is accessible 24/7, allowing potential customers to find and learn about your small business
                        anytime, anywhere. It's also a direct channel for communication with your customers - you can share updates,
                        news, and promotions, and customers can easily contact you with inquiries or feedback. This fosters stronger
