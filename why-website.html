            <div class="section just-text">
                <p>Are you a small business that already has a website (but it has been neglected), or are you
                    considering to get
                    one?</p>
                <p>If you're unsure is it worth your time and money to invest into having a well built and maintained
                    website, here
                    are the 5 main benefits for your small business:</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <p>A well maintained website helps establish your small business as being trustful, making it more appealing to
                        potential customers. Also, it allows you to showcase your products, services, and the story of your business
                        to a wider audience, increasing awareness and recognition.</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <p>A website is accessible 24/7, allowing potential customers to find and learn about your small business
                        anytime, anywhere. It's also a direct channel for communication with your customers - you can share updates,
                        news, and promotions, and customers can easily contact you with inquiries or feedback. This fosters stronger
                        customer relationships.</p>

                        or as a lead generation tool (nurturing leads into paying customers), it can definitely increase your
                        revenue. On top of that, it can help reduce operational costs by providing self-service options for
                        customers, freeing up staff time and resources.</p>

                    <p>A small business website can be a powerful marketing tool, allowing you to implement various marketing

                        helps attract more visitors to your website and generate leads.</p>

                        your small business. Also, social media algorithms dictate how your small business content is seen by its
                        audience, making it difficult to maintain consistent communication.</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <p>Small business that relies only on social media for marketing is at the mercy of the platform's rules and
                        policies, which can change at any time. If a social media platform decides to restrict or ban your account,
                        you could lose your entire online presence overnight.</p>
