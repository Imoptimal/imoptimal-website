                <p>You managed to get some traffic to your small business website, but have trouble converting enough visitors into clients? The checklist I've created will help you increase the conversion rate - by improving all the technical aspects of your website (speed, accessibility, privacy and security).</p>

                    <p>I know it seems daunting when you face all of the different online aspects of your small business - from the content
                        creation and marketing, to the legal and technical requirements for your website. But you should have in mind that
                        those requirements are usually meant to protect and benefit your clients, and that's also in your best interest. Ask
                        yourself - if I was in their shoes, would I want to do business with someone who has a terrible website that's
                        confusing and virtually unusable, that doesn't respect my data privacy (collects it and uses it without my consent),
                        and doesn't care if that data is stolen or leaked?

                        you don't get into any legal trouble - it will also significantly increase chances that any visitor of your small
                        business website, becomes your client. Following those best practices will make your potential clients trust you
                        more, and thus be more opened for collaboration.</p>

                        click. The truth is this: it's an ongoing process, that requires your involvement (no different to any content
                        strategy also). There's no one else that knows all the details of your business, like yourself. Anyone else can only
                        be your guide and assistant. This checklist is created for that very reason - to give you guidance when building and
