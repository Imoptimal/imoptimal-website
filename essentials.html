              <div class="section just-text">
                <p>Using recommended WordPress plugins [link that opens in new tab] will certainly help you meet many of the requirements for your small business website. However, there are certain things you can't do with any automated tool - you need to do it manually. The checklist I've created will help you stay on top of all of the requirements regarding data privacy, web accessibility, speed optimization, and security of your website. </p>

              <div class="section one">
                <img class="lazy-loading"

                    height="600" />
                <p>I know it seems daunting when you face all of the requirements imposed on your small business, for any activity you do online. But you should have in mind that those regulations are usually meant to protect and benefit your clients, and that's also in your best interest. Ask yourself - if I was in their shoes, would I want to do business with someone who has a terrible website that's confusing and virtually unusable, that doesn't respect my data privacy (collects it and uses it without my consent), and doesn't care if that data is stolen or leaked?
                </p>

                    height="600" />
                <p>Best practices (for data privacy, web accessibility, speed optimization, and security) will not only ensure that you don't get into any legal trouble - it will also significantly increase chances that any visitor of your small business website, becomes your client. Following those best practices will make your potential clients trust you more, and thus be more opened for collaboration.</p>

                <p>There are many (usually costly) solutions out there promising to solve all of your problems with one simple click. The truth is this: it's an ongoing process, that requires your involvement. There's no one else that knows all of the details about your business, but you. Anyone else can only be your guide and assistant. This checklist is created for that very reason - to give you guidance when building and managing your small business website.</p>
