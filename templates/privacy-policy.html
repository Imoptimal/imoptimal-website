        <h3>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h3>
        <p>This website collects personal data through the consultation scheduling form by <a href="https://calendly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Calendly</a> (which consists of your name, email, website and preferred contact
            app information). This data will not be available to anybody else but me, and will not be used for any other purpose (data processing, promotions/spamming).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>How long we retain your data</h3>
        <p>Personal data from the consultation scheduling form is stored until you request it to be deleted. If you require this data to be deleted, contact me through the contact form below</p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: Use the same email address as the one you used for scheduling, because it's needed in order to notify Calendly which user data to delete. Data will be deleted 7 days after I notified Calendly, and I do my best to check my emails daily.
            The full information about their data deletion can be found on this link - <a href="https://calendly.com/app/organization/settings/data_deletion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Calendly - Data Deletion</a></p>
