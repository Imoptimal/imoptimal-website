- Add everything in between coments of <-- Site Header - Start --> and <-- Site Header - End -->, and <-- Site Footer - Start --> and <-- Site Footer - End --> to each page (copy from index.html). Those sections need to be updated manually on each page.

- Add images as the \<img class="lazy-loading" data-src="./images/image-name.png" alt="Description." draggable="false" width="pictureWidth" height="pictureHeight"/>. All images are hosted on https://cloudinary.com/

- For links loading in slide-in section, add data-href property instead of href property, with the full link or relative github file path (to html template file).
