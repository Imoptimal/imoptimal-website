            <h2 class="page-title">Why is WordPress a good solution for your small business website?</h2>
            <div class="section just-text">
                <p>You probably came across a number of different options for building out your small business website. Most of them
                    promise a simple solution to get you started, for a seemingly affordable price. But what they don't tell you, is
                    the most important thing to have in mind - once you choose their service/product, you're locked in. Growing your
                    website, or moving it to another platform, becomes practically impossible (due to high additional costs).</p>
                <p>If you want a full ownership of your small business website, including code and content - choose WordPress. Also,
                    it's main features (known as WordPress core) are completely free. Besides being an open source platform, it has
                    many other advantages. Here are 3 main advantages of WordPress:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section one">
                <h3>Flexibility:</h3>
                <img class="lazy-loading"
                    data-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/imoptimal/image/upload/v1707424288/Small%20business%20website/Why-wordpress/small-business-website-why-wordpress-quote-1.png"
                    alt="Small business website - why wordpress (You can add any feature you need!)" draggable="false" width="600"
                    height="600" />
                <div class="story">
                    <p>There's countless number of themes and addons (known as plugins), providing any feature you can imagine. From
                        a simple blog, e-commerce store, online community or e-learning platform, there's nothing you can't build
                        with WordPress. In comparison to many other platforms with a limited set of features, you're not restricted
                        to choose any addon (plugin). Best of all - for most small business website use cases, those addons are
                        free.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section two">
                <h3>Scalability:</h3>
                <div class="story">
                    <p>As your business grows, your website shouldn't lag behind, just because you chose a wrong solution at the
                        start. If you build your small business website with WordPress, you can start with a simple website and add
                        more functionality as needed. While many other platforms have hard limitations on your website storage or
                        traffic, WordPress gives you a possibility to change hosting without any restrictions.</p>

                        encounter. That help is often free of charge, but sometimes you'll come across an issue requiring

                <p>You should be mindful of the fact that every choice has some pros and cons. Here's few things to consider when
                    choosing WordPress for your small business website:</p>
                <div>
                    <h3>Security:</h3>
                    <p>WordPress is the most popular platform (over 40% of websites use it), so it's not unusual to hear about
                        hacker attacks.
                        Considering the size of WordPress ecosystem, those incidents are fairly rare. And it's usually an exploit of
                        a plugin or
                        a theme, not of the WordPress core itself. If you choose plugins that are updated often, with good
                        reputation, you have
                        nothing to worry about. Additionally, there are security plugins you can install on your small business
                        website.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Maintenance:</h3>
                    <p>Like any other software, WordPress requires some maintenance to keep it running smoothly. This includes
                        updating your
                        plugins and themes, and backing up your website on a regular basis. Even though there's an option to turn on
                        automatic
                        updates, it doesn't always work as expected. If your website has many features/plugins, you should do it
                        manually one by
                        one - and check for unusual behavior, or reported errors. As for the website backups, there are many plugins
                        you can
                        install for the case you need to restore it to a previous version (better safe than sorry). If you need any
                        help with
                        the maintenance of your small business website, schedule a free consultation with me.</p>
