            <div class="section just-text">
                <p>You probably came across a number of different options for building out your small business website. Most of them
                    promise a simple solution to get you started, for a seemingly affordable price. But what they don't tell you, is
                    the most important thing to have in mind - once you choose their service/product, you're locked in. Growing your
                    website, or moving it to another platform, becomes practically impossible (due to high additional costs).</p>
                    <p><b>If you want a full ownership of your small business website, including code and content - choose WordPress. Also,
                    it's main features (known as WordPress core) are completely free. Besides being an open source platform, it has
                    many other advantages. Here are 3 main advantages of WordPress:</b></p>

                <h2>Flexibility:</h2>
                <div class="story">
                    <p>There's countless number of themes and addons (known as plugins), providing any feature you can imagine. From
                        a simple blog, e-commerce store, online community or e-learning platform, there's nothing you can't build
                        with WordPress. In comparison to many other platforms with a limited set of features, you're not restricted
                        to choose any addon (plugin). Best of all - for most small business website use cases, those addons are
                        free.</p>

                    <p>As your business grows, your website shouldn't lag behind, just because you chose a wrong solution at the
                        start. If you build your small business website with WordPress, you can start with a simple website and add
                        more functionality as needed. While many other platforms have hard limitations on your website storage or
                        traffic, WordPress gives you a possibility to change hosting without any restrictions.</p>

                        encounter. That help is often free of charge, but sometimes you'll come across an issue requiring

            <div class="section just-text">
                <p>You should be mindful of the fact that every choice has some pros and cons. Here's few things to consider when
                    choosing WordPress for your small business website:</p>
                <div>
                    <h2>Security:</h2>
                    <p>WordPress is the most popular platform (over 40% of websites use it), so it's not unusual to hear about
                        hacker attacks.
                        Considering the size of WordPress ecosystem, those incidents are fairly rare. And it's usually an exploit of
                        a plugin or
                        a theme, not of the WordPress core itself. <b>If you choose plugins that are updated often, with good
                        reputation, you have
                        nothing to worry about. Additionally, there are security plugins you can install on your small business
                        website.</b></p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Maintenance:</h2>
                    <p><b>Like any other software, WordPress requires some maintenance to keep it running smoothly.</b> This includes
                        updating your
                        plugins and themes, and backing up your website on a regular basis. Even though there's an option to turn on
                        automatic
                        updates, it doesn't always work as expected. If your website has many features/plugins, you should do it
                        manually one by
                        one - and check for unusual behavior, or reported errors. <b>As for the website backups, there are many plugins
                        you can
                        install for the case you need to restore it to a previous version (better safe than sorry).</b> If you need any
                        help with
                        the maintenance of your small business website, schedule a free consultation with me.</p>
