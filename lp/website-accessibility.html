                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Like the website speed optimization, web accessibility is also crucial for improving your website's
                                        conversion rate and SEO ranking. That's because:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>it increases the size of your potential audience (and the number of potential clients);</li>
                                        <li>it improves the user experience for all of your website visitors (increasing the time they stay
                                            on a page, and the chance they'll convert).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Most of the website speed optimization steps I showed you before were "set it once and forget it".
                                        When it comes to website accessibility, it's rarely the case.</p>
                                    <p>Most recommendations here you'll need to follow each time you're publishing a new post or creating a
                                        new (landing) page on your website. But once you get used to this approach, it's not so intimidating
                                        as the first time.</p>
                                    <p>Let's start with the accessibility of your website's page structure.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Each time you're creating a page, you'll need to structure it according to the content you're
                                        presenting. Prepare your page content beforehand, and pause to think what's the best way to showcase
                                        it. The main goal is to make it as easy as possible to understand, and for visitors to take the
                                        desired action.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                <h4>2.1. Page title</h4>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Every page besides your homepage, starts with a title. In WordPress this title also determines that
                                        page's slug (part of the URL that's specific to that page). Page title has 2 important functions:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>it helps visitors understand what the page is about;</li>
                                        <li>it contributes to the SEO rankings of that page and your website overal.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                <h4>2.2. Page sections</h4>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Next, you need to think about the formatting of content on a page. You should break the text on a
                                        page into meaningful sections. Each section should start with a distinct subtitle (H2 tag in
                                        comparison to the main page title that's H1 tag). Images also help to break the monotony of a longer
                                        text.</p>

                            </div>
                            <div id="one-two-three">
                                <h4>2.3. Color scheme</h4>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>It goes without saying that every page on your website needs to use the same color scheme. Color
                                        consistency helps visitors to find/do what you intended for them to find/do.</p>
                                    <p>The colors you use need to be aligned with your overall brand design. Most importantly - color
                                        contrast between the text and background(s) needs to be high enough - otherwise the text won't be
                                        visible to all website visitors.</p>
                                    <p>Here's an example of low color contrast between the background and the text: [Check the image below]
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    height="1000" />
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>For certain page elements (like links and buttons), color shouldn't be the only thing that makes them
                                        stand out. If the color contrast fails, links should be detectable as underlined parts of text.
                                        Similar with buttons - use a distinct and consistent shape.</p>
                                    <p>This is an example of low color contrast and lack of underlines for links on a page: [Check the image

                                <h4>2.4. Additional considerations</h4>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>There are few more things to consider here - and they're a bit technical. The first thing is keyboard
                                        accessibility of your page content.</p>
                                    <p>If you're unfamiliar with the term - keyboard accessibility refers to a webpage being operable by
                                        someone using only a keyboard to access and control it. This includes users of screen readers, but
                                        can also include users who have trouble operating a pointing device such as a mouse or trackball, or
                                        whose mouse is not working at the moment, or who prefer to use a keyboard for input whenever
                                        possible.</p>
                                    <p>Don't get freaked out - only the interactive elements on a page need to be accessible by keyboard.
                                        Unfortunately, if you want to test it manually, you'll need to do it on a computer. If you choose to
                                        do it - use the TAB key to go through the interactive page elements. You'll see the grey border
                                        around the currently focused element. In this example, you see thst grey border on selected input
                                        field. [Check the image

                                </div>
                                <img class="lazy-loading"

                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>Fortunately, in case of WordPress, most themes from the official theme repository include those
                                        accessibility feature. I recommend using KadenceWP theme - it offers advanced building blocks for
                                        any small business website.</p>
                                    <p>Another thing to have in mind is the language settings of your website. It's important to set the
                                        main website language - so that screen readers could work accordingly. In WordPress it's quite
                                        straightforward. In the admin dashboard, open the main menu (located in the header section, top left
                                        corner). Find the 'Settings' menu item and tap it to open the sub-menu items. Now tap the 'General'
                                        submenu item to open the settings page. [Check the image

                                    <p>On the 'General Settings' page, scroll down until you come to 'Site Language' option with the

                                    <p>In comparison, when it comes to website navigation - it should be consistent throughout your website. You can change the menu items if needed on individual pages, but the design and it's functionality shouldn't change. That way you won't confuse people trying to navigate through your website.</p>
                                    <p>Talking about drop-down menus - they should be accessible with a keyboard. Plus, the user should be
                                        able to
                                        go through the menu and close it using just a keyboard - they shouldn't encounter a dead end.</p>
                                    <p>The navigation should be simple to use, so that visitors don't get confused or lost. Avoid adding too
                                        many
                                        links and other action items in the main menu. Everything that is of secondary importance should be

                                    <p>Here's an example of too many menu items - each with submenu items that open into a list of

                                        WordPress themes from the official .org theme repository have this feature by default - it's a
                                        requirement.</p>
                                    <p>If your theme doesn't provide this feature - there's one lightweight WordPress plugin that offers

                                    <p>We already mentioned some text formatting best practices in the previous step. Besides the length of
                                        the text, and the color contrast - one of the main issues for your website visitors is the text
                                        size.</p>
                                    <p>For the regular text on your website, I would recommend using at least the size of 16px. In case of
                                        small letters text don't go under 12px. On top of that, your website shouldn't disable the default
                                        web browser zoom feature - so visitors could zoom in when needed.</p>
                                    <p>When it comes to the fonts you're using - they should be easy to read. Lately I've seen many examples
                                        of unreadable fonts that mimic handwriting. There's no point in choosing a pretty font that some (or
                                        most) visitors won't be able to read.</p>
                                    <p>Here's such an example: [Check the image

                                    <p>Next, the text alignment of your paragraphs should be either to the left or to the right. Data shows

                                    <p>Images always help to break up the longer text, and they contribute to SEO rankings. Just make sure
                                        that each image has
                                        alt-text, in case images don't load properly (and for people using screen readers). Alt-text refers
                                        to textual
                                        description of the content visible in an image. It shouldn't be just stuffed with keywords, but
                                        genuinely helpful to you
                                        website's visitors.</p>
                                    <p>It's acceptable to make an image for a short punch line, but avoid using images instead of whole
                                        paragraphs. It's can be
                                        confusing for people using screen readers, to understand images in place of text.</p>
                                    <p>When using images as your page background - if there's any text positioned on top of it, it must be
                                        readable. Here's an
                                        example of text that's difficult to read because of the image background: [Check the image

                                    <p>There's two different ways to make text more readable:</p>

                                        <li>those text elements should have a solid color background set (with high color contrast to the

                                        <li>if it's possible, set an overlay to that background image (with opacity set between 0.5 to 0.9).

                                    <p>If you're using video or audio content, don't use auto-play feature. Auto-play is not only annoying,
                                        but can confuse
                                        website visitors. Always provide an option for users to stop, pause or mute your content. Have in
                                        mind that people like
                                        to consume multimedia in a variety of ways.</p>
                                    <p>For both audio and video content - take an additional effort to provide a written transcript. There
                                        are many online
                                        tools today that do it fast and free. Additionally, provide captions for videos. YouTube is always a
                                        good free option
                                        for your video content.</p>
                                    <p>Be very careful when if you're considering using video as a background. Keep it really short and with
                                        slow motions - it
                                        shouldn't be too distracting. As with image backgrounds - make sure that any text on top of that
                                        background is readable.</p>

                                    <p>As I said before - popular WordPress themes provide many accessibility features out of the box.
                                        However, it can be
                                        tricky to make certain advanced website features (added with plugins) accessible. That's why I
                                        always recommend
                                        installing the 'AccessYes Accessibility Widget' WordPress plugin.</p>
                                    <p>In your admin dashboard. - head over to the main menu, and find the 'Plugins' menu item. Tap on it to
                                        reveal the
                                        sub-menu items. Now tap on the 'Add New Plugin' to go to the 'Add Plugins' page.</p>
                                    <p>There you should type in the search input field the name of this plugin. Once it shows in your search
                                        results, tap the
                                        'Install Now' button to install it. It will take few seconds for the installation to finish. You'll
                                        know it's finished,
                                        because the 'Install Now' button will be changed into 'Activate' button. Tap on it to active the
                                        plugin. [Check the image

                                    <p>I'll share some tools I use in my workflow, to help you get started. These tools help to:</p>

                                    <p>The first step is to check your existing webpages for accessibility issues, to know what you need to
                                        change/improve. Although there are many online tools for this (including PageSpeed Insights), I
                                        recommend using <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation

                                        fields. Under those 2 sections, you'll see the contrast ratio score for colors chosen. The score is
                                        high enough if the score is highlighted with a green border. [Check the image
