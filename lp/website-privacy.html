                        <div class="text">
                            <p>Having a privacy policy on your website, not only helps you avoid legal troubles (since it's a
                                requirement in most parts of the world) - it helps you build trust with your website's visitors.
                                That trust:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>helps you keep more clients, since many people end their relationship with companies over data
                                    privacy concerns;</li>
                                <li>it enables a longer-term relationship with your clients (increasing their lifetime value -
                                    amount of money they spend on your products/services).</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>2. How to create a privacy policy page template</h3>
                        <div class="text">
                            <p>There's few ways to do create all of the needed statements for the privacy policy page on your
                                website:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Using online generators (websites specialized for creating privacy policy page templates);</li>
                                <li>Doing it directly in WordPress (that provides privacy policy page template out of the box).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The first way provides a more detailed template, but you need to embed it manually as a piece of
                                code. The second approach is simpler. But you can always combine them - paste needed parts of text
                                generated outside of WordPress, into an existing WordPress privacy policy page template.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>There are many online privacy policy generators, but I prefer a specific one for it's detailed
                                approach - <a href="https://termly.io/" target="_blank">Termly</a>. They have a free account option,
                                that enables you to create policy page templates for a single website.</p>
                            <p> When you head over to Termly website, you'll need to create an account. On their homepage, open the

                                in the header section, top right corner), by tapping on the icon. [Check the image below]</p>

                            <p>You're probably aware that's it's a legal requirement, to provide website users with cookie consent
                                form. This form should provide complete information about all of the scripts that collect data about
                                your website visitors. Scripts are grouped into different categories:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>necessary scripts that can't be turned off, since it would break your website (for example
                                    Cloudflare CDN security related scripts);</li>
                                <li>functional scripts that enable important additional features on your website (for example
                                    scripts related to social media content shared on a website);</li>
                                <li>analytical scripts that collect data about user behavior (for example Google Analytics, or some
                                    heatmap/session recordings services like Microsoft Clarity);</li>
                                <li>performance scripts that enhance your website's performance (any script related to website speed
                                    improvement);</li>
                                <li>advertisment scripts (any script related to ad campaigns).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>All but the necessary and functional scripts should be blocked by default, unless user decides to
                                enable them. Don't worry, you won't need to detect and group the website scripts manually. Most
                                popular cookie consent service providers scan your website and do this automatically.</p>
                            <p>The less known requirement about cookie consent form, is that you need to provide consent management.
                                This means that you need to enable the website visitors to opt-in and opt-out at any given time.
                                Also, you need to keep a consent log, in case of any legal trouble. Lastly, you should set a
                                duration of cookies under 6 months.</p>

                            <p>They scan your website for existing scripts and group them automatically. You can see this if you
                                open the 'Cookie Manager' in the main menu. You can also see all of the stored cookie consent
                                (accepted or rejected) if you open the 'Consent Log' menu item. That's only needed in case of a
                                legal dispute.</p>

                            <p>Now, let me show you how to set up cookie banner if you have a WordPress website. First, you'll need
                                to install 'CookieYes – Cookie Banner for Cookie Consent' plugin in your admin dashboard. You'll
                                need to do this in the desktop mode app, since there are some responsivness issue here as well.</p>
                            <p>Open your wp-admin dashboard, then head over to the main menu, and find the 'Plugins' menu item. Tap
                                on it to reveal the sub-menu items. Now tap on the 'Add New Plugin' to go to the 'Add Plugins' page.
                            </p>
                            <p>There you should type in the search input field the name of this plugin. Once it shows in your search
                                results, tap the 'Install Now' button to install it. It will take few seconds for the installation
                                to finish. You'll know it's finished, because the 'Install Now' button will be changed into
                                'Activate' button. Tap on it to active the plugin. [Check the image

                                main menu, as a 'CookieYes' top menu item. Tap on it to go to the plugin's settings page. Once
                                there, tap on the 'Connect to Web App' button to connect your CookiYes account with the WordPress
                                plugin.</p>
                            <p>You can use the standalone WordPress plugin, without connecting it to CookieYes account, but you'll
                                have limited features. [Check the image

                                managing many advanced website features on your phone. I'm using it for the CRM I use (Brevo). You
                                just need to get used to zooming in and out when needed.</p>
