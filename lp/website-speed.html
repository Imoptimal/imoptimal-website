                        <div class="text">
                            <p>In today's world, where everyone is used to fast loading apps and websites, you shouldn't
                                lag behind.
                                Your website visitors are not the only ones that value fast websites - search engines do
                                it also.
                                Website speed is one of the main factors for SEO ranking. Thus, website speed
                                optimisation:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>improves visibility of the website, ensuring more visitors (and potential clients);
                                </li>
                                <li>lowers bounce rate (visitors stay longer), increasing the chances for conversion.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The first place you should start with speed optimisation is the foundational layer -
                                that's the
                                website
                                server.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="one-two">
                        <h3>2. Why you should update PHP to the latest version?</h3>
                        <div class="text">
                            <p>If you're using WordPress, it's likely you already heard about PHP. It's a server side
                                programming
                                language that executes every page request in WordPress. This means that it has a big
                                impact on your
                                website overall performance.</p>
                            <p>Each new version of PHP is faster than the previous one (and reduces memory usage). Plus
                                it usually
                                comes
                                with patches for security bugs and vulnerabilities. That's why you should always tend to
                                have the
                                latest
                                version of PHP set on your hosting.</p>
                            <p>New PHP release happens approximately once a year, so you don't need to constantly check
                                for newer
                                versions. And have in mind that you should wait for about a month after the new release
                                before the
                                update. This will give time for WordPress plugins to adjust to the newest PHP version
                                and avoid any
                                conflicts/errors.</p>
                            <p>Before I explain how to change the PHP version of your website, I'll show you how to
                                easily check the
                                current PHP version in your WordPress admin dashboard.</p>

                            <p>Before you update the PHP version, there are few things to consider.</p>
                            <p>First, you should update the WordPress core, your theme and plugins to their latest
                                version. And if
                                you're using popular/reputable plugins, that are updated regularly, it's likely they're
                                keeping up
                                with
                                the PHP updates. Just remember the one month delay rule I mentioned before.</p>
                            <p>Once you update the PHP version - if there's indeed an error (caused by outdated PHP code
                                in your
                                WordPress theme or plugins), you should revert back to the previous PHP version. The
                                error log
                                should
                                clearly point to the plugin folder where the error occured. You should contact the
                                plugin's support
                                and
                                ask if they're planning an update and when. If they're not planning any updates,
                                consider to find an
                                alternative for that plugin.</p>
                            <p>As with any major update for your website - make a website backup just in case something
                                unpredictable
                                happens.</p>
                            <p>Now, let me show you how to update your PHP version.</p>

                            <p>This step depends on your hosting provider. If they're giving you the option to change it

                                it should be clearly visible in your website settings, once you login into your hosting
                                account. If
                                you can't find it, it's possible you can't access it directly by yourself. In that case,
                                you need to
                                contact their support and ask them to update PHP version or guide you through the
                                process of

                                provider's
                                server). This results in a variable speed performance, depending on the physical
                                distance of
                                the
                                user
                                from the server location - the bigger the distance the slower the loading time.</p>
                            <p>CDN doesn't only improve your small business website speed, but adds a layer of security
                                on
                                top. But
                                let's focus on the main subject of how to connect your website to a CDN and set it all
                                up.
                                </p>
                            <p>First of all, you should decide what CDN provider to choose. The most popular option,
                                that
                                also has a
                                free tier (good enough for most small business use cases) - is Cloudflare CDN.</p>
                            <p>Before we come to the main CDN options, I'll guide you through the process of creating a
                                Cloudflare
                                account, and show you all the things you need to setup first on their website.</p>

                                accessed more quickly. There are many different types of cache, but in the case of your
                                website -
                                there's egde and browser caching.</p>
                            <p>Edge cache stores frequently accessed data (website files) closer to the end users, at
                                the
                                edge of a
                                CDN
                                (physically closest server), to reduce latency and improve website loading time.</p>
                            <p>Browser cache stores a copy of the webpage's content (website files) on the device’s hard
                                drive
                                during
                                the initial (first) webpage visit. This way, the next time the user loads the page, most
                                of
                                the

                                is already stored locally and the page will load much quicker.</p>
                            <p>If you followed the previous article and added your domain to Cloudflare CDN -
                                you

                                of these cache options for your website. By default Cloudflare CDN caches most of the

                                your website loaded onto the page (media files - images, videos; CSS and JavaScript
                                files).
                                However,

                                and find the 'Plugins' menu item. Tap on it to reveal the sub-menu items. Now tap on the

                                set
                                to 1 year

                                default (expressed in seconds). I would recommend changing this to 1 month, since your
                                website
                                should be
                                updated regularly with fresh content. The number you need to set here in seconds is
                                2.592.000
                                (equivalent to
                                30 days).</p>
                            <p>The second option - 'Browser Cache-Control max-age' is set to 1 minute by default. I would recommend setting this to 604.800 seconds (equivalent to 1 week).</p>
                            <p><b>IMPORTANT</b> - you should also check the box to purge the cache for related pages,
                                each

                                <p>There's more than one way to optimize your images:</p>
                                <ul>

                                    (usually
                                    smaller
                                    than
                                    the original size);</li>
                                <li><b>Compression</b> to reduce the image file size, while preserving their quality;
                                </li>

                                    smaller in
                                    size.</li>

                            <p>While they's always an option to manually optimize your images before upload, it takes
                                more
                                time and
                                effort than using existing WordPress plugins.</p>
                            <p>When it comes to image resizing - WordPress resizes (and crops) any uploaded image to 3
                                different
                                sizes.
                                These sizes are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Thumbnail (150 x 150px)</li>
                                <li>Medium (300 x 300px)</li>
                                <li>Large (1024 x 1024px)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Usually, this significantly reduces the size of your website images, because most
                                WordPress
                                themes
                                use those default image sizes or set their own custom resolutions.</p>
                            <p>You can change these sizes in your admin dashboard - found in the main menu, under the
                                'Settings'
                                section, the 'Media' submenu item. In most cases, you shouldn't change these default
                                settings. [Check the image below]</p>

                            <p>WordPress also stores the original image files and their resolutions, but it's rarely
                                needed.
                                Actually, WordPress scales down high resolution images to 2560 x 2560px (or smaller
                                based on
                                original aspect ratio), and uses them instead of originals.</p>
                            <p>Considering devices people use for web browsing, and their screen sizes, you don't need
                                anything
                                larger than that, even if you're building an image intensive portfolio website (for

                                graphic design etc.).</p>
                            <p>In case you need to resize or crop your website images, WordPress provides a basic image

                                can tap on any image to see it's current dimensions. There's also a button 'Edit Image'

                                <p>When it comes to image compression, there are WordPress plugins that offer this without
                                    changing the
                                file type of your images. But I would always recommend you to use a plugin that converts
                                all
                                of your
                                images to WebP format - reducing file size of your images for at least 50%. This new
                                image
                                format is

                                    Now tap on the 'Add New Plugin' to go to the 'Add Plugins' page.</p>
                                <p>There you should type in the search input field the name of this plugin. Once it shows in
                                    your search
                                    results, tap the 'Install Now' button to install it. It will take few seconds for the
                                    installation
                                    to
                                    finish. You'll know it's finished, because the 'Install Now' button will be changed into
                                    'Activate'
                                    button. Tap on it to active the plugin. [Check the image below]</p>

                                While you can do this manually on the web, it would require you to do one file at a

                                why it's faster and easier to do it with a WordPress plugin.</p>
                                <p>There's a number of few options for this, but my recommendation is 'Merge + Minify +

                                    simple to set up, with a handful of options strictly focused on file minification and

                            <p>As always, the first thing is to install this plugin in your admin dashboard. Head over

                                to finish. You'll know it's finished, because the 'Install Now' button will be changed

                            <p>Although 'Merge + Minify + Refresh'' plugin offers a compression option, it's better and
                                easier to
                                set it through the Cloudflare CDN (you already connected to your website in one of the
                                previous
                                steps).</p>
                            <p>The first step here is to head over to the Cloudflare CDN website, and log into your
                                account.
                                Once
                                you log in, select your website under the websites list - by tapping its name. [Check the image below]</p>
