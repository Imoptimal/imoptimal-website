                        <div class="text">
                            <p>Data privacy concerns often lead to loss of clients, and prevent forming long-term relationship with
                                them. But it's not enough just to have a good privacy policy - you need to stand by it and practice
                                what you preach.</p>
                            <p>Website security best practices are fundamental in ensuring that all the user data stays safe, and
                                most importantly:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>it prevents you from loosing money on potential data breach lawsuits;</li>
                                <li>it helps you avoid a variety of costly consequences of hacker attacks (malware, ransomware,
                                    etc.).</li>

                        <h3>2. Data encryption (SSL certificate)</h3>
                        <div class="text">
                            <p>The first thing you need to ensure is that all of the data traffic on your website is encrypted
                                (masked/hidden to any outsiders trying to exploit it). In other words you need a SSL certificate for
                                your website, that usually comes in a package with your hosting plan. SSL doesn't only provide data
                                encryption, it also verifies a server's identity - helping you gain trust with users. On top of
                                that, most web browsers clearly mark websites without SSL certificate as unsafe. Sometimes you can't
                                even access those unsafe websites.</p>
                            <p>If your hosting package doesn't provide a free SSL certificate, I would recommend getting it through
                                Cloudflare CDN (content delivery network). Cloudflare CDN doesn't only provide a free SSL
                                certificate, but it offers a number of security features for free - ddos protection, spam and
                                content scraping prevention. If your hosting plan includes SSL certificate, <a

                            <p>I've shown Cloudflare account creation and encryption setup in one of the steps for website speed
                                optimisation. If you need to create the SSL certificate, head over to the Cloudflare dashboard, and
                                select your website. On the overview page for your website, open the main menu (located at the top
                                left corner). Now tap the 'SSL/TLS' menu item, and open the 'Origin Server' settings page. [Check

                                the very top

                            <p>Don't be intimidated by these technical terms - it's a quite straightforward proces. First you
                                generate the
                                certificate (in form of text), that you copy/paste in your hosting's dashboard (usually cPanel).</p>
                            <p>You can generate the certificate by tapping the button 'Create Certificate' on the 'Origin Server'

                                page. This will open the 'Origin Certificate Installation' section. In most cases, there's no need
                                to change any
                                of the default values. Simply scroll down the page and tap the 'Create' button. [Check the image

                            <p>Now you'll see 2 important pieces of text - the 'Origin Certificate' and 'Private Key'. You should
                                copy both of
                                those values, by tapping the 'Click to copy' links below each section. IMPORTANT NOTE: you should

                                private key to a text file you can access later if needed - since you won't be able to access it in

                                Cloudflare dashboard again. Otherwise, you'll need to revoke the existing certificate, and create
                                the new one. [Check the image below]</p>

                        <div class="text">
                            <p>Content management systems (CMS), like WordPress, simplify the creation and maintenance of websites
                                of all types and sizes. In order to provide a bunch of features, every CMS requires many moving
                                parts that often come from third-party sources. In case of WordPress, we're talking about the themes
                                and plugins (including block libraries). You never know if those third-party pieces contain some
                                malicious code or user data exploits. That's why you should regularly update all of the software
                                behind your website. Also, you should periodically scan your website's files for vulnerabilities.
                            </p>
                            <p>On top of that, every CMS provides an option for users to log in and access a website's dashboard -
                                from admins to many other types of regular users (in case of a membership or e-commerce website).
                                This functionality comes with it's own potential security risks, related to unwanted access to your
                                website's files or database.</p>
                            <p>In case of WordPress, you can get most of the needed security features by installing a single plugin
                                - 'Wordfence'. Best of all, this plugin offers those security features for free. First step is to
                                install the plugin in your admin dashboard.</p>
                            <p>Head over to the main menu, and find the 'Plugins' menu item. Tap on it to reveal the sub-menu items.
                                Now tap on the 'Add New Plugin' to go to the 'Add Plugins' page.</p>
                            <p>There you should type in the search input field the name of this plugin. Once it shows in your search
                                results, tap the 'Install Now' button to install it. It will take few seconds for the installation
                                to finish. You'll know it's finished, because the 'Install Now' button will be changed into
                                'Activate' button. Tap on it to active the plugin. [Check the image below]</p>

                                the plugin's firewall will be set to learning mode for the first week. This helps the plugin to set
                                it's rules according to your specific case, based on your website features and activity. After the
                                week has passed, firewall will be turned on automatically.</p>

                            <p>When it comes to two-factor authentication settings, it's a bit more complicated. This method of
                                logging
                                security relies on something you know (login details) and something in your possession (phone or
                                email). That's
                                why it is referred to as “two-factor” because two factors are involved in authenticating you.</p>
                            <p>It's important to additionally secure the accounts with administrator and editor permissions -
                                because they have
                                access to website files or the content, and you shouldn't risk it. For other regular users, without
                                those
                                permissions, it could be annoying to be required to use 2FA. For those users you can make it
                                optional.</p>
                            <p>In your wp-admin dashboard, head over to the 'Login Security' submenu item, in the 'Wordfence' main
                                menu
                                section. You'll see 2 tabs: 'Two-Factor Authentication'. and 'Settings'.</p>
                            <p>The first and by default opened tab provides you with a scan code (entry key) to be used for
                                registering your
                                website on a authentication app of your choosing. Below that, you'll see a recovery code, that
                                should be copied
                                to a secure location - if you ever lose access to your authenticator device. At the bottom of this
                                tab, you'll
                                see an inpit field where you should copy the 6-digit code from your authentication app, to activate
                                2FA for your
                                own account. [Check the image below]</p>

                                else. As I said, I recommend you to set it to required for administrators and editors. Don't forget

                        <div class="text">
                            <p>Like any software, WordPress recieves updates regularly - to add new features, improve it's
                                performance, and fix bugs or security issues. Besides the WordPress core, each theme and plugin also
                                gets updates on a regular basis.</p>
                            <p>It's important to know there are 2 different types of updates to the WordPress core:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Major updates - that happen only few times per year, and include big changes (adding/modifying
                                    features);</li>
                                <li>Minor updates - usually related to fixing newly reported bugs or security issues (those updates
                                    are more often).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>By default, your WordPress website executes minor updates automatically. That's because those updates
                                usually won't break any functionality of the website.</p>
                            <p>When it comes to major updates, you have an option to turn automatic updates as well - but I wouldn't
                                advise it. It takes at least few days for the developers of most WordPress plugins, to update them
                                and adapt to major changes in the WordPress core.</p>
                            <p>You can always check for avilable update in your wp-admin dashboard. In the main menu, under the
                                'Dashboard' menu item, you'll see the 'Updates' sub-menu item. [Check the image below]</p>

                                of all, those features are available for free. The plugin I'm talking about is the 'UpdraftPlus -
                                Backup/Restore'.</p>
                            <p>Head over to the main menu, and find the 'Plugins' menu item. Tap on it to reveal the sub-menu items.
                                Now tap on the 'Add New Plugin' to go to the 'Add Plugins' page.</p>
                            <p>There you should type in the search input field the name of this plugin. Once it shows in your search
                                results, tap the 'Install Now' button to install it. It will take few seconds for the installation
                                to finish. You'll know it's finished, because the 'Install Now' button will be changed into
                                'Activate' button. Tap on it to active the plugin. [Check the image below]</p>

                        <div class="text">
                            <p>When it comes to online security, there's never enough caution. If you compromise the device you're
                                accessing your website's admin dashboard - all of the previous security measures will be useless.
                                That's why I'll share few useful tips about web security in general.</p>
                            <p>It goes without saying that you should have a phone lock enabled. No matter the type of phone lock,
                                it shouldn't be predictable - for example don't use a number like '0000' or '1234'.</p>
                            <p>Even though the operating system of your phone provides some basic security features and scans, I
                                recommend you to install an additional security application. I use 'AVG AntiVirus & Security' on my
                                Android phone, because it offers most of the essential features for free. [Check the image below]

                            <p>In the worst case scenario - if you loose your phone, make sure to force a logout from all of the
                                accounts if possible (like Google, Apple, etc.). Search the web for the term 'force logout' in
                                combination with the service name, to find out if and how it's possible to do so. [Check the image

                        <h3>2. Email/account security</h3>
                        <div class="text">
                            <p>Your email account is usually linked to many other online services (social media, banking, app store,
                                etc.). That's why you should do your best to secure it.</p>
                            <p>Again, don't use a predictable password - add s combination of letters, numbers, and at least one
                                special character.</p>
                            <p>You should also enable the 2FA (two-factor authentication) for your email account, if it's available.
                                Connect it to your phone number preferably, or an authentication app.</p>
                            <p>My suggestion is to have two different email accounts. One should be used/connected to the most
                                important things that are crucial for your livelihood (like banking & your website). The other one
                                should be used for everything else - app store, social media, etc.</p>
                            <p>The reason is simple - the less services connected to your email account, the smaller the chance it
                                gets compromised. And once you stop using any online service, disconnect it from your email account.
                                Search the web for the term 'revoke access to' in combination with the email service provider name,
                                to see how to do so. [Check the image

                            <p>Lastly, if your using a WiFi connection to access the internet, there are few things to consider.</p>
                            <p>As with anything else, don't use a predictable password for your WiFi network at home. If you're
                                using a WiFi in a coffee shop, even if it's password protected - use a VPN service.</p>
                            <p>VPN stands for a virtual private network. that encrypts all of the data - adding a security layer to
                                the data traffic between your device and the web. I use a free service, in a form off an android
                                phone app - 'VPN Proton'. [Check the image

                            <p>If you're connected to a public WiFi hotspot, that usually has no password protection, use a VPN.
                                Most importantly - avoid using services with sensitive data (like banking apps, or any payment
                                processing).</p>
                            <p>I'll leave you with one last advice - use only the services you truly need, and don't share your data
                                without second-guessing each decision.</p>
